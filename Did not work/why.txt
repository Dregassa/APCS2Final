Why goals were not achieved

Cell class did not work because using it would require instantiating 81 cells every time a new puzzle was created.

Sudoku puzzle generator was not completed because of issues with inserting numbers. First tried to create it by randomly inserting numbers into the array, but there is a limit to how this can create a puzzle, as randomly inserting may sometimes lead to a case where there is no space to put in new numbers while still adhering to the rules. Extensive backtracking was needed.
