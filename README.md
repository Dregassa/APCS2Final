## Project :: Sudoku

User will will be presented with the sudoku puzzle with a random amount of numbers removed from the puzzle. 

We will attempt to create the sudoku puzzle by using a pre solved sudoku solutions. To create more solutions, we will be using transformations to change things up before we remove. To create the puzzle, we will be removing the numbers in groups. If the removal of a number leaves no solution, we will back track. 

To launch, run the Game.pde file in processing.
